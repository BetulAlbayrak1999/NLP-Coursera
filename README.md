### Preprocessing
In this lab, we will be exploring how to preprocess tweets for sentiment analysis. We will provide a function for preprocessing tweets during this week's assignment, but it is still good to know what is going on under the hood. By the end of this lecture, you will see how to use the NLTK package to perform a preprocessing pipeline for Twitter datasets.

### 2Word Frequencies
Building and Visualizing Word Frequencies
In this lab, we will focus on the build_freqs() helper function and visualizing a dataset fed into it. In our goal of tweet sentiment analysis, this function will build a dictionary where we can look up how many times a word appears in the lists of positive or negative tweets. This will be very helpful when extracting the features of the dataset in the week's programming assignment. Let's see how this function is implemented under the hood in this notebook.
